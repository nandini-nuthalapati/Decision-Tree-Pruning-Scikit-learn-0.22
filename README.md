# Decision Tree Pruning Scikit-learn 0.22
 Decision tree minimal cost-complexity pruning is one of the recent release highlights of scikit-learn version 0.22. With 'ccp_alpha' parameter, it is now possible to prune most tree-based estimators once the trees are built.
 Read https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#minimal-cost-complexity-pruning for how the parameter works.
